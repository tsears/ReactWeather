# react-weather #

For my first React project I decided to treat my [existing weather app](https://github.com/tsears/MVCWeather) as a template with the goal of recreating the funcitonality.  I recently replaced the asp.net MVC backend in favor of a [new weather backend](https://github.com/tsears/NodeWeather) built on node+aws (cloudformation/lambda/api
gateway).

For this frontend project, I ran create-react-app and immediately ejected.
